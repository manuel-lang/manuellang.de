- Data-driven learning of clustering algorithms for text and image data that I also applied to learn combinations of distance metrics
- Implemented several algorithms from scratch in C++ resulting in significantly improved runtime compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and also better clustering qualities for all used text and image datasets
- Publicated results at ICLR 2019
- Advised by Prof. Maria-Florina Balcan
